# Starting stage.

# Whether or not to run all the stages. Set to false to only run one stage.

# Features to use in training. Default is MFCCs. 
# Possible values: mfcc, mfcc_deltas, sdc, pitch_energy, energy, pitch, 
# sdc_pitch_energy, mfcc_deltas_pitch_energy, sdc_pitch, sdc_energy
feature_type=mfcc

# Whether to use VAD for removing non-speech frames. Default: true
use_vad=true

# Whether to compute VAD over the features generated for this experiment. If false, vad.scp 
# will be taken from the mfcc experiment directory to ensure the same VAD filtering is 
# applied to any kind of features. Note that re-computing VAD requires that the first number
# in each feature vector acts as energy (or as C0 in MFCCs). Default: false

# The experiment mode. Can be 'full', i.e. trying to run the whole experiment
# including computing features, training the TDNN and classifier and evaluating.
# An alternative is 'test_only' which translates to just generating test features, 
# producing their x-vectors, training the classifier and evaluating on test data.
mode=test_only

# The directory of the experiment from which the trianed TDNN will be taken.
# Use for instance with mode=test_only.

eval_utt_len=3

# Whether to do feature computing, x-vector extraction and scoring on the test
# set or not. If false, then only the eval set is considered.
