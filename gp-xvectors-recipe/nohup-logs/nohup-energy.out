 	 This shell script runs the GlobalPhone+X-vectors recipe.
 	 Use like this: ./run.sh <options>
 	 --stage=INT		Stage from which to start
 	 --run-all=(false|true)	Whether to run all stages
 	 			or just the specified one
 	 --experiment=STR	Experiment name (also name of directory 
 	 			where all files will be stored).
 	 			Default: 'baseline'.
 	 --exp-config=FILE	Config file with all kinds of options,
 	 			see conf/exp_default.conf for an example.
 	 			NOTE: Where arguments are passed on the command line,
 	 			the values overwrite those found in the config file.

 	 If no stage number is provided, either all stages
 	 will be run (--run-all=true) or no stages at all.
